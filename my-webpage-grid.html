                    As a k-drama binge watcher, learning Korean for better understanding comes with understanding the dialogue
                    and refraining from reading the subtitles. Learning Korean will help me connect more deeply with the
                    characters. This will also enhance my overall enjoyment of K-dramas , as I can pick up the subtle jokes. As
                    a TEFL certificate holder , exploring the culture can open up new possibilities for me.
